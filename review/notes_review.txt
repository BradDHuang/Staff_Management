Only Class Component has state, functional Component does not.

setState() may be asynchronous.

Only class component has life cycle methods.


The bodies of class declarations and class expressions are executed 
in strict mode, 
that is the constructor, static and prototype methods. 
Getter and setter functions are executed in strict mode.

// e.g.
    function display(){
        console.log(this); // 'this' will point to the global object
    }
    display(); 

This is a plain function call. 
The value of this inside the display() method in this case 
is the window — or the global — object in non-strict mode. 

    In strict mode, 
    the this value is 
    undefined.
